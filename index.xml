Search for and install updates a few times in a loop # Some packages and updates depend on others already being installed, so they might not show up during the first search for updates. If you want to make sure &amp;ldquo;everything&amp;rdquo; has been installed and/or updated it is best to re-run Get-LSUpdate and Install-LSUpdate a few times or until no more updates are found.</description></item><item><title>BIOS/UEFI and Firmware updates</title><link>https://jantari.github.io/LSUClient-docs/docs/topics/bios-and-firmware/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jantari.github.io/LSUClient-docs/docs/topics/bios-and-firmware/</guid><description>BIOS/UEFI and other firmware updates # LSUClient will install BIOS/UEFI updates silently when possible.
Like with any other package, those for which a silent installation is supported will have their .Installer.Unattended property set to $True. If you get a BIOS/UEFI update for which .Installer.Unattended is $False, that means it uses a type of installer/flasher for which either no silent install options exist or for which LSUClient doesn&amp;rsquo;t support performing silent installs yet.</description></item><item><title>Self-hosted repositories</title><link>https://jantari.github.io/LSUClient-docs/docs/topics/self-hosted-repositories/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jantari.github.io/LSUClient-docs/docs/topics/self-hosted-repositories/</guid><description>Self-hosted repositories # By default LSUClient fetches packages from the official, public Lenovo Update Catalog at https://download.lenovo.com/catalog. However, just like System Update, it also supports custom, self-hosted package repositories.
It is currently not possible to create or manage such a custom package repository with LSUClient. Self-hosted repositories must either be created with the &amp;ldquo;Lenovo Update Retriever&amp;rdquo; program or finagled in place manually or with your own scripts if you understand the structure (see repository formats).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jantari.github.io/LSUClient-docs/docs/topics/versioning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jantari.github.io/LSUClient-docs/docs/topics/versioning/</guid><description>Versioning # LSUClient uses a three-part version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH and follows SemVer 2.0.0.
This means you can generally expect all your scripts and integrations to keep working with any one major version (such as 1.x.x).
There is only ever one current release of LSUClient, there is no parallel maintenance of older releases or prior versions. As soon as a new release is out the prior one is obsoleted.
What is and isn&amp;rsquo;t covered by the semantic versioning promise # Semantic versioning communicates changes in a softwares &amp;ldquo;public API&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
